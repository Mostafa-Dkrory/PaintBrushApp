🎨 Creating Art with Java: Introducing the Paint Brush App! 🖌️

As a passionate developer, I’m thrilled to share my latest project: The "Paint Brush App" is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) program that allows users to draw various shapes, lines, and freehand sketches on a canvas, Implemented the OOP principles for code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.🎉

Key Features:

1. Change Background Color: Customize your canvas by selecting different background colors. Whether you prefer a serene blue or a vibrant red, the choice is yours! 🎨

2. Change Brush Color: Express your creativity by picking the perfect brush color. From calming pastels to bold primaries, let your imagination flow. 🖌

3. Draw Shapes: Create geometric wonders! Draw lines, rectangles, and ovals effortlessly. Perfect for diagrams, flowcharts, or just doodling. 📏

4. Fill or Dotted Shapes: Need a solid rectangle or a dashed line? Our app lets you choose between filled or dotted outlines for your shapes. 💭

5. Freehand Paint Mode: Unleash your inner artist! Use the mouse like a traditional paintbrush to create freehand masterpieces. 🖌

6. Undo: Oops, made a mistake? No worries! Hit the undo button to revert your canvas to its previous state. 🔙

7. Clear All: Starting fresh? Clear the entire canvas with a single click. Say goodbye to unwanted doodles! 🗑

8. Save Your Art: Capture your creativity! Save your artwork as an image file for future reference or to share with friends and colleagues. 💾

9. Open Existing Images: Continue working on your saved projects or use reference images. The “Open” feature lets you pick up where you left off. 🖼
